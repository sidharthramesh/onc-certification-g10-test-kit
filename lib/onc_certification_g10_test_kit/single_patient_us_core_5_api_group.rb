    title 'Single Patient API (US Core 5.0.1)'
    description %(
      For each of the relevant USCDI data elements provided in the
      CapabilityStatement, this test executes the [required supported
      searches](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU4/CapabilityStatement-us-core-server.html)
      as defined by the US Core Implementation Guide v5.0.1.

      The test begins by searching by one or more patients, with the expectation
      that the Bearer token provided to the test grants access to all USCDI
      resources. It uses results returned from that query to generate other
      queries and checks that the results are consistent with the provided
      search parameters. It then performs a read on each Resource returned and
      validates the response against the relevant
      [profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5.0.1/profiles-and-extensions.html)
      as currently defined in the US Core Implementation Guide.

      All MUST SUPPORT elements must be seen before the test can pass, as well
      as Data Absent Reason to demonstrate that the server can properly handle
      missing data. Note that Encounter, Organization and Practitioner resources
      must be accessible as references in some US Core profiles to satisfy must
      support requirements, and those references will be validated to their US
      Core profile. These resources will not be tested for FHIR search support.
